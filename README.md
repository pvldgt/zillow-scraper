# Zillow price, address and link scraper. 

This script takes a Zillow property search link (you should filter it however you like it beforehand),
then it scrapes the page for the property address, price and link and inserts this data into a Google form that you've created.  
The Google Form should follow the following structure: Address, Price, Link. All the questions should be set to "Short Answer".  
Once all the information is entered, you may view it in the spreadsheet (it can be accessed in the "Responses" section of your Google form).
